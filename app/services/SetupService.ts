           This option will pause playing audio in the background when the app is removed from recents. The notification remains and can be used to resume playback.

         StopPlaybackAndRemoveNotification
           This option will stop playing audio in the background when the app is removed from recents. The notification is removed and can't be used to resume playback. Users would need to open the app again to start playing audio.
